/**
 * @file tempdirs.h
 * @brief The plugin's temporary directories, named after the process.
 *
 * A session without a save path writes into a directory
 * "logsquirl-logcat-<pid>-XXXXXX" in the temporary root.  The process ID in the name lets a plugin
 * instance find the directories of earlier instances in the same LogSquirl process (after the
 * plugin was disabled, updated and enabled again), and those of LogSquirl processes that ended
 * without removing theirs.
